cout << "INPUT:" << endl;
cout << "If you start this program, it will ask you to input two matrices in following format:" << endl;
cout << "height width" << endl;
cout << "1st row" << endl;
cout << "......." << endl;
cout << "nth row" << endl;
cout << "example:" << endl;
cout << "3 3" << endl;
cout << "1 2 3" << endl;
cout << "4 5 6" << endl;
cout << "7 8 9" << endl;
cout << "This programs main purpose is to show some parallel ways to multiplicate matrices." << endl;
cout << endl;
cout << "OUTPUT:" << endl;
cout << "It shows time of each action and at the end lets you choose if you want the solution to be printed." << endl;
cout << "First way is simply serial multiplication." << endl;
cout << "Second one is just simple use of omp library:\n#omp parallel for" << endl;
cout << "Third is optimized parallel multiplication using omp library:\n#pragma omp parallel for schedule(dynamic,50) collapse(2) private(i,j,k) shared(m1, m2, m3)" << endl;
cout << "Fourt way uses only threads with no special libraries." << endl;
